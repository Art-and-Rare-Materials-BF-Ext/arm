# ArtFrame and RareMat

ArtFrame, led by Columbia University, is an extension of BIBFRAME to describe art objects, both two-dimensional (e.g., paintings, photographs) and three-dimensional (e.g., sculptures, ceramics). <br /><br />
In conjunction with the ACRL Rare Books and Manuscript Section's Bibliographic Standards Committee (RBMS-BSC), Cornell University Library is leading an effort to build an ontology extension for the description of rare materials. This collaborative effort is intended to provide RBMS-BSC with a model for handling the complexity of rare materials, particularly item-level description not addressed in BIBFRAME 2.0 or bibliotek-o. Adoption and usage of the Rare Materials Ontology Extension will be determined by RBMS-BSC following initial development and assessment.<br /><br />
For a number of modeling areas, such as measurements, provenance and physical description, the ArtFrame and RareMat groups partnered to address overlapping use cases.
