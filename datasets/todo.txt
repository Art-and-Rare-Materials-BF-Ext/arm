* MEASUREMENT RECOMMENDATION

- Units: NASA QUDT Units Ontology http://www.qudt.org/qudt/owl/1.0.0/unit/index.html
- For arrangements, such as rolled, folded, etc. a vocabulary will have to be 
developed. 
- For dimension types, such as height, width, weight, etc. use AAT, Art & 
Architecture Thesaurus.

For parts measured (e.g. container, mount, platemark): Each domain 
implementing this model will need to define their own classes.
